First, this was a time when the world was witnessing the formation of sovereign countries by way of independence from colonial powers and the splitting of countries. Second, at the very same time, other Himalayan kingdoms like Nepal and Bhutan were fortifying their sovereignty. At such a time, Sikkim made the cardinal reverse move to join the Indian Union.</p>\\n<p>India’s long struggle against colonial powers and its commitment to democracy had won the hearts of the Sikkimese people. Finally, on April 14, 1975, over 97.5% of the Sikkimese people voted in favour of a merger with India. I believe that a greater example of Indian patriotism has never been displayed before and after this.</p>\\n<p>Much water has flown under the bridge since then. Following on the heels of the merger, an anti-merger narrative soon gathered force and de-merger became the dominant political agenda. When my party, the Sikkim Democratic Front, formed the government in December 1994, we gave a call to arms for the Sikkimese people to emotionally integrate with India. Our slogan was Sikkim hamro Sukhistan, desh hamro Hindustan (Sikkim is our Sukhistan and our country is Hindustan). Our goal was to help Sikkim overcome its merger hangover and transform itself into our own Sukhistan within our Hindustan.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_143371\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone amp-wp-ac3245d\" data-amp-original-style=\"width: 860px\"><amp-img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-143371\" class=\"size-full wp-image-143371 amp-wp-enforced-sizes i-amphtml-layout-intrinsic i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oped-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oped-2.jpg 850w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oped-2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oped-2-768x510.jpg 768w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oped-2-52x35.jpg 52w\" layout=\"intrinsic\" i-amphtml-layout=\"intrinsic\"><i-amphtml-sizer class=\"i-amphtml-sizer\"><img alt=\"\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"i-amphtml-intrinsic-sizer\" role=\"presentation\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,<svg height=&quot;565&quot; width=&quot;850&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot;/>\"></i-amphtml-sizer><noscript><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-143371\" class=\"size-full wp-image-143371\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oped-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oped-2.jpg 850w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oped-2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oped-2-768x510.jpg 768w, https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/oped-2-52x35.jpg 52w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\"></noscript></amp-img><p id=\"caption-attachment-143371\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mount Kanchenjugha, in Sikkim, India.</p></div>\\n<p>The public response was overwhelming. Sikkim not only attained complete emotional integration but the logical extension of the process was a reverse integration that Sikkim witnessed in the last few years: Other states and countries were now coming to learn from Sikkim. Sikkim shed its longstanding tag of being a sleepy state and enjoyed the national limelight by way of some enviable feats.</p>\\n<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi sharing Sikkim’s organic story in Parliament, and in Germany and Nepal, was powerful testimony to that fact. Sikkim became India’s ‘Greenest State’ in 1998, first Nirmal Rajya in 2008, first Open Defecation Free State in 2016, and the world’s first Organic State in 2016. Sikkim bagged over 100 national awards including the cleanest state of India by the Swachh Sarvekshan Gramin 2016 report and the prestigious “Oscar for best policies”, the Future Policy Gold Award 2018 by the UNFAO for becoming a 100% organic state. Sikkim also won the Best State for Comprehensive Development of Tourism Award during the National Tourism Awards 2016-17.</p>\\n<p>Another example for reverse integration was the record arrival of domestic tourists to Sikkim. We won the best tourism award in the Northeast from 1998-2004 consecutively and many more times in later years. Not long ago, Sikkimese people visiting Indian cities were often mistaken for foreigners. That’s now history. Sikkim, with a population of just about seven lakh, received over 15 lakh domestic tourists annually until the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>\\n<p>Democratic values and social equality are inseparable. My government’s maiden budget in 1994 allocated 70% for rural development. I consider the reduction of the BPL population from 41.43% in 1993 to 8.19% in 2011-12 one of our biggest governmental achievements. As recorded by the World Bank, this is the steepest reduction in poverty in the shortest possible time since World War II. The surge in higher institutes of learning from zero to five universities and two colleges to over 25 during our governance was hailed nationally.</p>\\n<p>Sikkim’s major policy decisions like the ban on the use of plastics (1989), Capacity Building (2003), CM’s Rural Housing Scheme (Rs 15 lakh worth house for each family), CM’s Meritorious Scholarship (CMMS) in 2009, One Family One Job (2019) have been worthy of national replication. Under CMMS, hundreds of class five toppers from poor families have been selected every year for sponsorships in the country’s top schools. Students have availed themselves of free scholarships in the world’s top 20 universities under the CM’s Free Scholarship scheme.</p>\\n<p>This journey deserves deeper assessment. The May 8, 1973 Agreement was a pre-merger political milestone which had a tremendous bearing on Sikkimese life. It carried the hopes and aspirations of the people of Sikkim and promises of equality, which are yet to be fulfilled. As we celebrate our great nation’s 73 years of freedom, the Sikkimese people look on with hope that these aspirations will certainly find fulfilment.</p>\\n    </div>\\r\\n        <div class=\"disclaimer\"> DISCLAIMER : Views expressed above are the author\\'s own. </div>    \\t\\t<div class=\"panel authors mobile-authors sidebarPanelNew\">\\r\\n\\t  <div class=\"panel-heading\">\\r\\n\\t\\t<h3 class=\"panel-title\">Author</h3>\\r\\n\\t  </div>\\r\\n\\t  <div class=\"panel-body\">\\r\\n\\t\\t<a class=\"pull-left\" title=\"Go to the profile of Pawan K Chamling\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/author/pawan-k-chamling/\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<amp-img layout=\"responsive\" class=\"media-object amp-wp-enforced-sizes i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pawan-Chamling-52x37.jpg\" alt=\"Pawan K Chamling\" width=\"52\" height=\"37\" i-amphtml-layout=\"responsive\"><i-amphtml-sizer style=\"display:block;padding-top:71.1538%;\"></i-amphtml-sizer><noscript><img class=\"media-object\" src=\"https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Pawan-Chamling-52x37.jpg\" alt=\"Pawan K Chamling\" width=\"52\" height=\"37\"></noscript></amp-img>\\r\\n\\t\\t</a>\\r\\n\\t\\t<a class=\"media-heading\" title=\"Go to the profile of Pawan K Chamling\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/author/pawan-k-chamling/\" rel=\"bookmark\"><b>Pawan K Chamling</b></a>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"bio\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div id=\"mb-showmore-143370\" hidden>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe writer is former Chief Minister of Sikkim<br><br>    \\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div id=\"mb-showless-143370\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe writer is former Chief Minister of Sikkim<br><br>    \\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>    \\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  </div>\\r\\n\\t</div>\\r\\n<div data-amp-original-style=\"clear:both;\" class=\"amp-wp-b68207d\"></div>\\r\\n<amp-ad type=\"colombia\" layout=\"responsive\" data-clmb_slot=\"322451\" data-clmb_position=\"1\" data-clmb_section=\"0\" data-clmb_divid=\"c\" data-loading-strategy=\"1.25\" width=\"300\" height=\"780\" heights=\"(min-width:780px) 120%, 130%\" data-npa-on-unknown-consent class=\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout=\"responsive\"><i-amphtml-sizer style=\"display:block;padding-top:260.0000%;\"></i-amphtml-sizer></amp-ad>\\r\\n<div data-amp-original-style=\"clear:both;\" class=\"amp-wp-b68207d\"></div>\\r\\n<amp-ad type=\"colombia\" layout=\"responsive\" data-clmb_slot=\"322453\" data-clmb_position=\"1\" data-clmb_section=\"0\" data-clmb_divid=\"c\" data-loading-strategy=\"1.25\" width=\"300\" height=\"780\" heights=\"(min-width:780px) 120%, 130%\" data-npa-on-unknown-consent class=\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout=\"responsive\"><i-amphtml-sizer style=\"display:block;padding-top:260.0000%;\"></i-amphtml-sizer></amp-ad>\\r\\n<div data-amp-original-style=\"clear:both;\" class=\"amp-wp-b68207d\"></div>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n<!-- Comment section -->\\n<div class=\"comments\">\\n\\t<div class=\"cmtbtn-wrapper\">\\n        <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/a-journey-towards-democracy-sikkim-has-achieved-significant-milestones-since-its-1975-merger-with-india/?comments=show\" class=\"cmtbtn view\">View<span>4</span>comments</a>\\n        <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/a-journey-towards-democracy-sikkim-has-achieved-significant-milestones-since-its-1975-merger-with-india/?comments=show\" class=\"cmtbtn add\"><span class=\"icon\"></span><span>Post a comment</span></a>\\n    </div>\\n</div>  \\n<div class=\"bottom-comments\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"comment-box level1\" data-id=\"2584947726\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"user-thumbnail\"><amp-img layout=\"responsive\" class=\"userimg flL amp-wp-enforced-sizes i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" src=\"https://mytimes.indiatimes.com/image/thumb/0/default\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" i-amphtml-layout=\"responsive\"><i-amphtml-sizer style=\"display:block;padding-top:100.0000%;\"></i-amphtml-sizer><noscript><img class=\"userimg flL\" src=\"https://mytimes.indiatimes.com/image/thumb/0/default\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\"></noscript></amp-img></div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<a href=\"http://mytimes.indiatimes.com/profile/714185137\" class=\"name\" target=\"_blank\">Raman NR</a>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p class=\"short_comment amp-wp-aeb737c\" data-amp-original-style=\"cursor:default;\">Only wish the best for Sikkim.
