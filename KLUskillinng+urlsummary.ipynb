       "'The three accused were a party to the criminal conspiracy, the court held. (Representational)\\n\\nFormer Samata Party president Jaya Jaitly and two others have been convicted by a court in New Delhi in a nearly 20-year-old graft case related to a purported defence deal that stemmed from a sensational sting operation by Tehelka news portal.\\n\\nSpecial CBI judge Virender Bhat held Jaitly, her former party colleague Gopal Pacherwal and Major General (retired) SP Murgai guilty of corruption and criminal conspiracy.\\n\\nThe sting, \\'\\'Operation Westend\\'\\', was aired by Tehelka in January 2001 in which the accused purportedly accepted bribe from reporters of the the portal, who posed as representatives of a fictitious company, for supply orders for hand held thermal imagers from the army.\\n\\nThe meetings took place in the official residence of the then defence minister George Fernandes.\\n\\nIn its July 21 order, the court observed that while Ms Jaitly accepted illegal gratification of Rs 2 lakh from Mathew Samuel, a representative of the fictitious company Westend International, Mr Murgai received Rs 20,000.\\n\\nThe three accused, along with Surender Kumar Surekha who later turned an approver, were a party to the criminal conspiracy, the court held.\\n\\nAll the three accused - Ms Jaitly, Mr Pacherwal and Mr Murgai - were convicted of the offence of conspiracy (Section 120-B IPC) read with Section 9 (Taking gratification, for exercise of personal influence with public servant) of Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act.\\n\\nThe court is scheduled to hear arguments on quantum of sentence on July 29.\\n\\nThe court held that \"from the evidence lead by the prosecution it is proved beyond doubt that in the meeting in the hotel room on December 25, 2000 Surekha and Murgai assured their assistance to Samuel in procuring letter of evaluation for the product of his company from the Ministry of Defence and also to arrange a meeting between him and accused Jaya Jaitly who would provide political cover to them in this regard.\"\\n\\nIt was agreed that Samuel would pay a sum of Rs. 1 lakh each to Surekha and Murgai and a sum of Rs 2 lakh to accused Jaitly in this regard, the order said.\\n\\n\"Thus there had been an agreement between them to obtain the evaluation letter for the concerned product by illegal means i.e. by resorting to corruption and personal influence upon the concerned officials,\" the court said.\\n\\nThe court observed that \"such kind of agreement was clearly tantamount to offence of conspiracy\".\\n\\nThereafter, Surekha contacted Pacherwal and roped him in the conspiracy, it said. \"Accordingly, Pacherwal arranged the said meeting for December 28, 2000. He too was present in the said meeting in the room of Ms Jaitly along with Surekha, Samuel and Murgai.\\n\\n\"In that meeting, which took place in the official residence of the then Union Minister for Defence, George Fernandes, Samuel was introduced to Jaitly as a businessman whose company intends to enter the market of defence procurement.\\n\\n\"Samuel offered the sum of Rs 2 lakh to Jaitly who instructed him to handover the money to Pacherwal and accordingly, the money was received by accused Pacherwal knowing that it was bribe money.\\n\\n\"In lieu thereof, Jaitly assured Samuel that in case the product of his company is not considered, she would intervene by making a request to \\'\\'Sahib\\'\\' (purportedly Fernandes) to send a word to the concerned officer in this regard,\" the judge observed.\\n\\nTherefore, both the accused Pacherwal and Jaitley, having joined the conspiracy at a later point of time with the knowledge about the object and having agreed to perform the task assigned to them towards its fulfilment, are also guilty of the offence of conspiracy, the court said.\\n\\nIt said. \"Jaitly received a sum of Rs 2 lakhs through Pacherwal from Samuel as a motive/reward for agreeing to accomplish the task given to her i.e. to exert personal influence upon the concerned Ministers/ Officers in pushing the product of the company of Samuel into the Indian Army.\"\\n\\nSimilarly, Mr Murgai received a sum of Rs 20,000 from Samuel on January 4, 2000 for the assistance rendered by him in arranging a meeting with Ms Jaitly and securing letter of evaluation for the product of the company by exercise of personal influence upon the concerned officers, the court noted.\\n\\n\"Therefore, both of them have committed offence envisaged under Section 9 of the PC Act,\" it said.\\n\\nMs Jaitly, who was Fernandes\\'\\' close aide, resigned as Samata Party chief following the graft allegations.\\n\\nThe charge sheet against the three was filed in 2006 and the charges were framed in 2012.\\n\\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)'"

 \\n        <div class=\"RichTextArticleBody-body\"><div>By Leigh Ann Caldwell</div>\\n<div id=\"pnlByline\">\\n<p>CNN</p>\\n</div>\\n<div>\\n<p>WASHINGTON (CNN) — Not everyone subscribes to a New Year’s resolution, but Americans will be required to follow new laws in 2014.</p>\\n<p>Some 40,000 measures taking effect range from sweeping, national mandates under Obamacare to marijuana legalization in Colorado, drone prohibition in Illinois and transgender protections in California.</p>\\n<p>Although many new laws are controversial, they made it through legislatures, public referendum or city councils and represent the shifting composition of American beliefs.</p>\\n<p><strong>Federal: Health care, of course, and vending machines</strong></p>\\n<p>The biggest and most politically charged change comes at the federal level with the imposition of a new fee for those adults without health insurance.</p>\\n<p>For 2014, the penalty is either $95 per adult or 1% of family income, whichever results in a larger fine.</p>\\n<p>The Obamacare, of Affordable Care Act, mandate also requires that insurers cover immunizations and some preventive care.</p>\\n<p>Additionally, millions of poor Americans will receive Medicaid benefits starting January 1.</p>\\n<p>Thousands of companies will have to provide calorie counts for products sold in vending machines.</p>\\n<p><strong>Local: Guns, family leave and shark fins</strong></p>\\n<p>Connecticut: While no national legislation was approved to tighten gun laws a year after the Newtown school shooting, Connecticut is implementing a final round of changes to its books: All assault weapons and large capacity magazines must be registered.</p>\\n<p>Oregon: Family leave in Oregon has been expanded to allow eligible employees two weeks of paid leave to handle the death of a family member.</p>\\n<p>California: Homeless youth are eligible to receive food stamps. The previous law had a minimum wage requirement.</p>\\n<p>Delaware: Delaware is the latest in a growing number of states where residents can no longer possess, sell or distribute shark fins, which is considered a delicacy in some East Asian cuisine.</p>\\n<p><strong>Illinois and drones</strong></p>\\n<p>Illinois: passed two laws limiting the use of drones. One prohibits them from interfering with hunters and fisherman. The measure passed after the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said it would use drones to monitor hunters. PETA said it aims through its “air angels” effort to protect against “cruel” and “illegal” hunting.</p>\\n<p>Also in Illinois, another law prohibits the use of drones for law enforcement without a warrant.</p>\\n<p><strong>Gender and voting identity</strong></p>\\n<p>California: Students can use bathrooms and join school athletic teams “consistent with their gender identity,” even if it’s different than their gender at birth.</p>\\n<p>Arkansas: The state becomes the latest state requiring voters show a picture ID at the voting booth.</p>\\n<p><strong>Minimum wage and former felon employment</strong></p>\\n<p>Workers in 13 states and four cities will see increases to the minimum wage.</p>\\n<p>While most amount to less than 15 cents per hour, workers in places like New Jersey, and Connecticut.</p>\\n<p>New Jersey residents voted to raise the state’s minimum wage by $1 to $8.25 per hour. And in Connecticut, lawmakers voted to raise it between 25 and 75 cents to $8.70. The wage would go up to $8 in Rhode Island and New York.</p>\\n<p>California is also raising its minimum wage to $9 per hour, but workers must wait until July to see the addition.</p>\\n<p>Rhode Island: It is the latest state to prohibit employers from requiring job applicants to signify if they have a criminal record on a job application.</p>\\n<p><strong>Social media and pot</strong></p>\\n<p>Oregon: Employers and schools can’t require a job or student applicant to provide passwords to social media accounts.</p>\\n<p>Colorado: Marijuana becomes legal in the state for buyers over 21 at a licensed retail dispensary.</p>\\n<p>(Sourcing: much of this list was obtained from the National Conference of State Legislatures).</p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"pnlContributors\">\\n<p>CNN’s Christine Romans and Emily Jane Fox contributed to this report</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>The-CNN-Wire<br>\\n™ &amp; © 2013 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
